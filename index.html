			<h1 class="display-1">Clifford Carnmo</h1>
			<p>For almost 15 years I have been building and leading agile engineering teams and coaching engineers in their personal growth and development. I strongly believe in servant leadership and the value of a healthy work environment and culture. With my strong technical background as a software developer, I am able to credibly lead, coach and motivate teams and engineers as a role model in both words and actions.</p>
			<p>During my time as a leader and manager I have always kept on programming and being involved in the software development process. <strong>This is important to me</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Areas of expertise</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Situational, modern and agile servant leadership in engineering environments and organizations.</li>
				<li>Active, clear, confident and explicit coaching that promotes individual development through positive and constructive feedback.</li>
				<li>Passionate and personal leadership characterized by energy, trust, competence and pride.</li>
				<li>Recruiting, staffing and retaining highly competent engineering teams.</li>
				<li>Inspiring, diverse and inclusive engineering environments where perspectives are valued, ideas welcome and where goals are reached and celebrated together.</li>

				<li>Implementing and improving agile mindsets and DevOps practices.</li>
				<li>The constant strive for improvement in a learning culture with a collaborative attitude.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Key drivers and motivation</h2>
			<p>I get my energy from managing and evolving highly functioning engineering- and software development teams. I find it very stimulating to be confronted with situations where the outcome is not clear. To learn is to live and I truly enjoy sharing knowledge and the process of learning together with others. After 27 years in the IT industry, I still love every day I get to work with brilliant people on challenging projects.</p>
